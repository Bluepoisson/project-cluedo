# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

Create an online Cluedo game from template, in 4 steps: create objects, create arrays, pick items and reveal mystery.

## The problem

Still in recovery from having been sick the entire week before, not optimal but alright.
Had fun researching what the game actually is, building an html + css, only to realise that the forked file contained everyting I needed to start off. It did crunch my drive, I felt utterly stupid and a failure. Lesson learned: forked file first.

Not having spent the expected time studying the past week, I would be happy if I could catch up enough to make blue level.
The page should be styled and contain 3 clickable randomised cards and one clickable button to reveal the mystery.

I copied the forked file, working on a copy following the given 4 steps. Focused on getting the javasvript, followed by css and adding when needed to the html.

I am beginnning to understand that I need at least one visual element that inspires me in order to keep working. This time it was the shadow elements. After having swapped the assets file for my own images file.

Technologies used: Visual studio code, Firefox dev tools, Imagecolor picker, Responsinator, Git Hub Desktop.

If I had more time I would look for more images so that all the decks are complete, add a reset function to play more than one time.
I would also strive for red and black levels, making the objects more complex.
